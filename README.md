# CyberVNC - VNC Data Exfiltration Detection and Prevention Testbed

## Project Overview

CyberVNC is a comprehensive testbed system designed to simulate and prevent data exfiltration attacks through TigerVNC and RealVNC servers. This project addresses the critical security vulnerabilities inherent in VNC implementations and provides detection, prevention, and hardening mechanisms.

## Background

Internet connectivity has enabled global LAN systems to span continents, making VNC (Virtual Network Computing) servers essential for remote access. However, VNC inherently provides weak security with no passwords or encryption by default. While TigerVNC and RealVNC offer TLS solutions, data exfiltration remains a significant concern for both insider threats and external attackers who gain VNC server access.

## Project Goals

- Simulate all possible data exfiltration scenarios via TigerVNC and RealVNC
- Develop comprehensive detection mechanisms using network monitoring tools
- Implement prevention strategies through firewall configurations and access controls
- Provide actionable hardening recommendations for production environments
